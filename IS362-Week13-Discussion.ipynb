    "My attempt to reverse Engineer YouTube's recommder system uncovered the following information:\n",
    "  - YouTube's interface showcases a personalized homepage with video recommendations based on the user's watch history, subscriptions, and liked videos. \n",
    "  - The platform encourages engagement through comments, likes, and shares. \n",
    "  - The site offers features like playlists, trending videos, and a sidebar displaying related content.\n",
    "  - The recommendation algorithms seem to pay close attention to how much time each viewer views a particular video, and how much engagement the user has with the video. For example, did they comment or copy the link to share it? The site will then suggest similar videos based on the observed interactions."

    "To Enhance the Recommendation System, I would:\n",
    "1) Offer a variety of recommendations, in addition to those that seem most similar to the user's interest, to perhaps introduce other content the user may not know they could find interesting.\n",
    "2) I would offer user's greater control of the algorithms that recommend content, hopefully allowing them for a better experience after fine-tuning it with perhaps whitelist and blacklist capabilities.\n",
    "3) Use advanced ML or AI to better analyze content, thereby finetuning recommendations better as well as filter out unethical or bad content from reaching any viewer."
